# FFTPGA

This page is to implement a fast fourier transform algorithm in an fpga board. It also includes an audio processor as well as an LCD screen driver, so that the LCD(if plug in) will show the spectrum of the input audio signal through the fft module.

This project will be introduced by 3 parts: 

1. the LCD driver
2. the audio interface (WM8978 chip)
3. the fft module

## 1. LCD driver

The film transistor-liquid crystal display is one of the most popular display devices nowadays. It is widely used in TV, mobile phone, dashboard and other devices. Although the display quality is worse than that of OLED screens, LCDs are still favored by the market because of their low prices.

A 4.3-inch LCD screen with 480*272 resolution is used in this project. Therefore, the relevant codes are also designed in accordance with this specification. If other resolution screens are used, please adjust the relevant parameters to obtain a normal display effect.
